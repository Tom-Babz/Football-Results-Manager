# Football-Results-Manager
The Football Results Manager was created as apart of an assessment for the Fundamentals of Computer Programming module in the first year of my degree. 
To use the application you input data in the format: Home_Team_Name [Home_Team_Score] | Away_Team_Name [Away_Team_Score]. Features in the program include storing user input, validating input, being able to read user input from a file, create HTML reports from the user input and more.
